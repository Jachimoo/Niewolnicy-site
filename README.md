# Purpose

This site was created to promote our actions and music, as a place where we can store our memories of concerts, events and it is small time machine for us.

# How is it builded?

Site is builded using [GRAV](https://getgrav.org). I choose this one because at that time I don't feel confident enought to build such website for scrach, whitch doesn't meant that was easy. Site fully designed and fully animated by me. I also made most of content by my own. After all this is only a portfolio for my band.
